/*
Using the identify vowel function, create a second function that accepts a string argument,
 and returns a string without any vowels in it. 
 This function should use the identify vowel function you wrote to ascertain if a character is a vowel or not.
 
Note - strings are just arrays. It is fine to write something like: 

for( let i = 0; i < stringVarName.length; i++ ){

    let char = stringVarName[i];

}
